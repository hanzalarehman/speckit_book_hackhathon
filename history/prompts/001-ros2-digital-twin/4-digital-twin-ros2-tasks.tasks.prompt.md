## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

Generated a detailed list of tasks for the 'Digital Twin Simulation for Humanoid Robots' feature, organized by user story and implementation phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive task list created, ready for implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Generated tasks file.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now proceed with /sp.implement or /sp.adr if they wish to document the earlier suggested architectural decision.
- 🧠 Reflection: Continued challenges with script execution necessitate manual PHR creation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Manual PHR creation due to script issues.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate PowerShell script execution in agent environment for PHR generation.
