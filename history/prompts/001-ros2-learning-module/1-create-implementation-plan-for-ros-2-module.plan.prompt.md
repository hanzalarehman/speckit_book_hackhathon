title: Create Implementation Plan for ROS 2 Module
stage: plan
date: 2025-12-07
surface: agent
model: gemini
feature: 001-ros2-learning-module
branch: 001-ros2-learning-module
user: hanzalarehman
command: /sp.plan This plan defines the creation of an AI/Spec-driven book built with Docusaurus, including an architecture sketch, full chapter and section structure, and quality validation steps aligned with the Constitution for accuracy, citation consistency, and reproducibility. It documents key decisions such as choosing the Docusaurus information architecture, determining the content generation flow from Spec-Kit Plus to Claude Code to Markdown, selecting a diagram strategy, and weighing static versus interactive content. The testing strategy includes validating chapter completeness against specifications, ensuring reproducible code blocks and build instructions, checking APA/IEEE citation formatting, confirming error-free Docusaurus builds, and verifying accessibility and site navigation. The project follows a spec-driven, iterative writing approach, generating content and research concurrently across phases of Planning, Drafting, Integration, Review, and Deployment.
